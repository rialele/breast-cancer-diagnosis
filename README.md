# Breast Cancer Diagnosis


The project incorporates several machine learning (ML) algorithms, 
including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic 
Regression, k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), 
Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and 
Naive Bayes (NB) in tandem with the 
Random Forest Feature Importance Method for feature
selection. These models have been trained on the Wisconsin 
Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset.
