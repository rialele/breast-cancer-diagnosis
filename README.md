# Breast Cancer Diagnosis

#### Obejctive:
The most prevalent malignancy in females and 
the second greatest reason for the loss of life from cancer is 
Breast Cancer. Hence, a computer assisted detection (CAD) 
system that uses a machine learning technique to give reliable 
breast cancer diagnosis is required. 
#### Overview:
The paper is aimed to 
incorporate several machine learning (ML) algorithms, 
including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic 
Regression, k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), 
Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and 
Nave Bayes (NB) with hyperparameter tuning in tandem with the 
Random Forest Feature Importance Method for feature
selection. These models have been trained on the Wisconsin 
Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) Dataset. 

#### Data Balancing: 
Furthermore, dataset was balanced using both Undersampling and SMOTE. Undersampling gave us an 
overall better result. 

#### Evaluation: 
The performance evaluation parameters for the designed model are specificity, accuracy, sensitivity, F1 
score, precision, recall and Area Under the Curve(AUC). 

#### Results:
The research concluded that the Support Vector Machine 
Algorithm proved to be the most effective model which fit our 
dataset with an Accuracy of 95.8% followed by KNN with an 
accuracy of 95.3%.
