# Breast Cancer Diagnosis

#### Overview:
The project is aimed to 
incorporate several machine learning (ML) algorithms, 
including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic 
Regression, k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), 
Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and 
Nave Bayes (NB) with hyperparameter tuning in tandem with the 
Random Forest Feature Importance Method for feature
selection. These models have been trained on the Wisconsin 
Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) Dataset. 

#### Data Balancing: 
Furthermore, dataset was balanced using both Undersampling and SMOTE. Undersampling gave an 
overall better result. 

#### Evaluation: 
The performance evaluation parameters for the designed model are specificity, accuracy, sensitivity, F1 
score, precision, recall and Area Under the Curve(AUC). 

#### Results:
The research concluded that the Support Vector Machine 
Algorithm proved to be the most effective model which fit our 
dataset with an Accuracy of 95.8% followed by KNN with an 
accuracy of 95.3%. 

#### Documentation:
The code.ipynb file contains the entire code along with comments.
