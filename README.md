# Breast Cancer Diagnosis


The project is aimed to 
incorporate several machine learning (ML) algorithms, 
including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic 
Regression, k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), 
Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and 
Naive Bayes (NB) with hyperparameter tuning in tandem with the 
Random Forest Feature Importance Method for feature
selection. These models have been trained on the Wisconsin 
Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) Dataset. 

The code.ipynb file contains the entire code along with comments.
